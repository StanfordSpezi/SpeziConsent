Present your user consent documents to read, sign, and export.

## Overview

SpeziConsent implements consent-flow-related infrastructure, providing both a data model (``ConsentDocument``) and views (``ConsentDocumentView``, ``OnboardingConsentView``, etc) for integrating Markdown-based consent documents into your app.

@Row {
    @Column {
        @Image(source: "Consent1", alt: "Screenshot displaying a simple consent form") {
            At its core, a ``ConsentDocument`` is a simple markdown document which the user is asked to sign.
        }
    }
    @Column {
        @Image(source: "Consent2", alt: "Screenshot displaying an interactive consent form") {
            In addition to standard markdown elements, the consent form may also contain custom, interactive toggle or selection components.
        }
    }
    @Column {
        @Image(source: "Consent3", alt: "Screenshot displaying an Interactive Consent Form with selection requirements.") {
            If specified, the consent form will validate the user's selection against an expected value, preventing the user from advancing unless they provide the correct response.
        }
    }
}


You app uses SpeziConsent by creating a ``ConsentDocument`` from a Markdown string or file.
A consent form consists of Markdown content (e.g.: text, headings, lists, etc), and can also contain custom interactive elements which enable support for simple user data collection directly as part of filling out the consent form.
For example, your app could define a consent document consisting of markdown text, followed by a toggle (which the user needs to explicitly set to true in order to confirm their willingness to participate in your study), and a signature field where the user needs to sign their signature.

The ``ConsentDocument`` type handles the state of a (potentially interactive) consent form; it is passed into e.g. a ``ConsentDocumentView`` or an ``OnboardingConsentView``, which present the consent form to a user, allowing them to sign the form and fill out its interactive elements.
Once the user has completed the form, you use the ``ConsentDocument/export(using:)`` function to obtain a PDF representation of the signed document.


### Consent Views

The following example creates a simple, reusable `ConsentStep` view which can be used e.g. as part of your app's onboarding.
The view implements both dynamic consent form loading from a file URL (e.g.: a resource in your app's bundle),
and also provides a share button in the top-right corner, allowing participants to keep a personal copy of the consent form they signed.
```swift
struct ConsentStep: View {
    let url: URL
    
    @State private var consentDocument: ConsentDocument?
    @State private var viewState: ViewState = .idle
    
    var body: some View {
        OnboardingConsentView(consentDocument: consentDocument) {
            // advance your Onboarding flow in response to the user having confirmed a completed consent document
        }
        .viewStateAlert(state: $viewState)
        .toolbar {
            ToolbarItem(placement: .primaryAction) {
                // give your user the ability to obtain a PDF version of the consent document they just signed
                ConsentShareButton(
                    consentDocument: consentDocument,
                    viewState: $viewState
                )
            }
        }
        .task {
            // load the consent document when the view is first displayed.
            // this will automatically cause the `OnboardingConsentView` above to update its contents.
            do {
                consentDocument = try ConsentDocument(contentsOf: url)
            } catch {
                viewState = .error(AnyLocalizedError(error: error))
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Your app would then use this `ConsentStep` when building up its Onboarding Stack:
```swift
ManagedNavigationStack {
    Welcome()
    EligibilityScreening()
    UserLogin()
    ConsentStep(url: Bundle.main.url(forResource: "consent", withExtension: "md")!)
    HealthPermissions()
    //
}
```

> Note: The [`ManagedNavigationStack`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/stanfordspezi/speziviews/documentation/speziviews/managednavigationstack) in the example above is from the [SpeziViews](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziViews) package.

### Consent Documents

Below is an example of a simple consent document that embeds several custom elements into its Markdown text:

```html
